need to think out flow of TTS feature:

user clicks audio button
sends http request containing poem lines
displays loading bar
on receipt of response, fires function to play text
for now thats just browser TTS for chrome.
can also be a second HTTP request to TTS or built into lambda function
loading bar is removed, displays audio STOP icon until audio stops playing
if presses play again will have another behavior
resets on page refresh or new poem (msut remove /reset all variables)




click read - makes request (loading)
when loading is done, triggers start reading
if audio playing, displays stop playing icon
else goes back.
